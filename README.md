# WiFiDebugging
Normally you connect your Android device via an USB-Cable to your PC and use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) for debugging. But you don't need the cable! Adb is able to connect to your phone via wifi. 
To simplify this, I wrote a simple application, which setups the wireless link to your devices.

### How To
If you start the program for the first time, you need to set the path to your Android Debug Bridge.

Click on "..." and search for your Android SDK folder. The adb lies inside the platform-tools folder. After that, click on OK and the program is ready for work.

The tool shows all connected devices width their ID and name. If you (dis-)connect a device, you should click on refresh to update the list of devices.
You can click on each device and switch between USB and WiFi mode.
